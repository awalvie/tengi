# tengi

tengi is my attempt at writing my own shell to have a better understanding of how processes work in Unix and how software *runs*.

I will be following [tokenrove's workshop](https://github.com/tokenrove/build-your-own-shell) because it doesn't provide you with the code but encourages you to find answers on your own.

### Build

```bash
$ cd tengi
$ ./build.sh
```
